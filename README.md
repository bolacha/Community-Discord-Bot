# Community-Discord-Bot
Discord bot built for the LetsLearnCommunity, by the members of the community :)

## Contributing
For features you contribute, please create a section inside the `discordBot` function, starting with a comment containing your discord and github usernames, and then all of the code for your features.

For development, make sure you throw your bot token into `botKey.txt` for authentication. (Also make sure it's in your .gitignore)
